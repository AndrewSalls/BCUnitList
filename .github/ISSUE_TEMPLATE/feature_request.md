**Think about the impact of your suggestion**
Would it be widely useful for other people? How much work would it take to implement?

**Describe the feature you think would improve the site**
Make sure it doesn't already exist via a setting, and that it's not already on the README as a planned/proposed feature.
Also, make sure that the feature you propose is a single feature or very closely linked set of features.

**Note: Any suggestions that require viewing or editing files directly from the app will not be considered.**

**PS: Don't spam issues or you'll get banned.**
