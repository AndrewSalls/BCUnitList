** Check that you aren't misreading anything **
Make sure that there is actually a mistake, and not just something that seems incorrect or data that is missing because the website hasn't updated to the current game version.

** Have you checked that in-game, the data is different than the site? **
The wiki is community edited, which sometimes means they've made a mistake. Data on this site is obtained mainly from Mirahaze, but also from some other sites. If you have proof (in-game screenshots) of a difference between the website's data and the game's data, put them here. If the mistake happens to also exist on Mirahaze, include that so that we know to check other sources.
