Check out the app on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jp.co.ponos.battlecatsen&hl=en_US">Android</a> or <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/the-battle-cats/id850057092">iOS</a>. If you haven't played the game this website isn't very useful...</p><p>And don't forget,</p><div id="home-cat-quote" class="h-align"><span id="home-splash"></span></div></section><section class="content-section hidden"><h2>All Units</h2><p>This tab displays a list of every unit in the game, sorted by rarity.</p><img src="./assets/img/home-tutorial/unit-row-example-1.png" loading="lazy"><p>By clicking or scrolling, you can change every aspect of a unit to match how you've upgraded them:</p><img src="./assets/img/home-tutorial/unit-row-example-2.png" loading="lazy"><hr><p>With so many units, it can be hard to find a specific one. Use the quick nav at the bottom left to jump to a unit or rarity.</p><img src="./assets/img/home-tutorial/unit-quick-nav-example.png" loading="lazy"><p>For more information on unit tables, check the unit tables section in the Miscellaneous section.</p></section><section class="content-section hidden"><h2>Single Unit</h2><p>If you just want to update a single unit, there's no reason to wait for all of the units' data to load.</p><p>This page displays all of a single unit's information on one page.</p><img src="./assets/img/home-tutorial/single-unit-example.png" loading="lazy"></section><section class="content-section hidden"><h2>Categories</h2><p>Categories are a way of organizing cats into groups of related units, such as all units from the same gacha banner, or all Li'l cats.</p><p>This tab acts the same as the All Units tab, but instead of tables for each rarity, there are tables for each category.</p><img src="./assets/img/home-tutorial/category-example.png" loading="lazy"><p>There are a bunch of predefined categories; you can customize which categories are shown, or create your own, in the Settings tab.</p></section><section class="content-section hidden"><h2>Upgrade Costs</h2><p>Ever wonder how much EXP you need to level up every unit to level 30. How about how much catfruit you need to farm?</p><p>In the Upgrade Costs tab, you can view the total amount of every resource in the game needed to fully upgrade every cat of a certain rarity or category.</p><img src="./assets/img/home-tutorial/cost-example.png" loading="lazy"><p>Total upgrade costs are shown for every unit rarity, and for every category of units (see Categories and Settings sections).</p><p>There are two special categories, "All Units", which is self-explanatory, and "Abilities", which are the non-cat upgrades shown in the in-game upgrade menu after the normal cats.</p><p>Finally, for any category with an Uber Super Rare, there is an option to include resources needed for Ultra Form and Ultra Talent related upgrades. When this is turned off, any upgrade that relies on spending Dark Catseyes is not counted in the upgrade costs.</p></section><section class="content-section hidden"><h2>Cat Base</h2><p>This page contains all of the upgrades that effect gameplay but aren't related to units.</p><p>At the top of the page is your total user rank, useful for seeing if you missed a unit when entering values. There are also several subtabs.</p><img src="./assets/img/home-tutorial/ur-example.png" loading="lazy"><p>The first subtab is for treasures. There is a slider for each treasure in each chapter, as well as buttons to quickly max treasures, since you have them all maxed, right?</p><img src="./assets/img/home-tutorial/treasure-example.png" loading="lazy"><p>The second subtab is for the Cat Cannon & variants. You can level up each part of the different designs.</p><img src="./assets/img/home-tutorial/cannon-example.png" loading="lazy"><p>The third subtab is for having purchased The Cat God (completely different from the popular unit Cat God), and for your levels in each Ability. Abilities are the blue orbs in the normal cat upgrade menu that aren't actually cats, e.g. the Study ability that increases EXP earned.</p><img src="./assets/img/home-tutorial/ability-example.png" loading="lazy"><p>The final subtab is for the random other upgrades that don't fit cleanly into a specific subtab. Right now, the only upgrades in here are the Aku Altar level cap, and a toggle for if the Aku Altar has been fully disabled.</p></section><section class="content-section hidden"><h2>Loadouts</h2><p>With the limited number of in-game loadouts, it can be difficult to save loadouts for specific stages.</p><p>In the Loadouts tab, you can create loadouts like in game, equipping cannon parts and any unit you own in the website. Ownership is defined as the unit being at least level 1.</p><img src="./assets/img/home-tutorial/loadout-example.png" loading="lazy"><p>You can also generate a share code. This code can be entered into the "Freeform Loadouts" view, which lets you create loadouts with any unit in the game, even if you haven't marked them as owned on the website.</p><p>These share codes are a great way to ask for advice on a loadout or to give someone a loadout to help them with a stage they're struggling on.</p><div class="v-align" id="home-break-overflow"><p>The loadout in the previous image, for example, can be loaded using the following code!</p><h6>eyJ0aXRsZSI6ImZpc2giLCJ1bml0cyI6WyJJNkYyTDIwKzkwIiwiSTY4NEYyTDUwIiwiSTk3RjJMNTAiLCJJMzZGMkw1MCszMFQxMC0wLTAtMC0wTzEtMC0yIiwiSTUxRjJMMzArNCIsIkkzMTFGMkwzMCs0NyIsIkk3NEYyTDMwIl0sImZvcm1zIjpbMCwwLDAsMiwxLDAsMF0sImJhc2VMZXZlbHMiOlsxLDEsMV19</h6></div><p>In the "Freeform Loadouts" view, you can also modify the unit's upgrades, and your cannon levels, without modifying your units elsewhere on the site.</p><img src="./assets/img/home-tutorial/freeform-loadout-modify-example.png" loading="lazy"></section><section class="content-section hidden"><h2>Settings</h2><p>There are several types of settings, starting with global unit filters. These are especially useful filters that apply to the entire website. This website contains every unit in every version of the game, but since it's primarilly English focused, units exclusive to non-English versions of the game are hidden by default using one of these global filters.</p><img src="./assets/img/home-tutorial/not-in-en-example.png" loading="lazy"><p>Next is the global category selection. This is like the global unit filters, but for entire unit categories. This does not effect the individual unit views, only categories as in the Categories and Upgrade Costs tabs.</p><img src="./assets/img/home-tutorial/category-selector-example.png" loading="lazy"><p>After that is the custom unit categories section. This allows you to create categories with any grouping of units you want.</p><img src="./assets/img/home-tutorial/custom-category-example.png" loading="lazy"><p>These custom categories work like any other category. You can even hide them in the global category selection if you want!</p><img src="./assets/img/home-tutorial/custom-category-result-example.png" loading="lazy"><p>Then, there are the settings that modify how you view the website. They are divided into three parts:</p><ul><li>Organization settings are settings that effect how some things get displayed, making it easier to focus on what you care about the most.<ul><li><p><b>Auto-Collapse Tables</b>: You can click on the title of any table that displays units to hide the units. This option has those tables start collapsed.</p></li><li><p><b>Auto-Collapse Category Sections</b>: Categories are divided into sections (e.g. "Collabs" or "Seasonal Events"). Like with tables, you can click on these section titles to collapse them, hiding all of the categories inside. This option has those sections start collapsed.</p></li><li><p><b>Single Category Display</b>: This option has the Categories and Upgrade Costs pages only show one category at a time, using the "Select Categories" panel at the bottom of the page to switch between categories.</p></li></ul></li><li>Default Sort settings is a single setting that controls exactly what the name suggests. Any table with units in it will be initially sorted using the sort specified here.<ul><li><b>In-Game Order</b> sorts units based on their order in the actual game, which is a weird mix of the unit's category, ID, and date added to the game.</li><li><b>ID</b> sorts units by the numerical order of their IDs.</li><li><b>Names</b> sorts units by the alphabetical order of their current form's name.</li><li><b>Forms</b> sorts units by their current form, Normal → Evolved → True → Ultra</li><li><b>Levels</b> sorts units numerically, first by total regular level, then by total plus level.</li><li><b>Talents</b> sorts units by their number of maxed talents, then by their number of upgraded talents.</li><li><b>Talent Orbs</b> sorts units by the rank(s) of their highest ranked orb(s), so 1 S rank orb beats 2 A rank orbs.</li><li><b>Favorited</b> puts favorited units before nonfavorited units.</li></ul>All of these sort options can be ascending or descending. If there is ever a tie, the tie is resolved by using the two unit's IDs in numerical order.</li><li>Other settings are miscellaneous settings that do something unique.<ul><li><p><b>Arrow Upgrade Controls</b>: Adds increment and decrement arrows for anything on the website that you modify by scrolling the mouse wheel. Good for people without a scroll wheel!</p></li></ul><img src="./assets/img/home-tutorial/arrow-control-example.png" loading="lazy"><ul><li><p><b>Show Empty Categories</b>: By default, any category containing only units that are filtered out by global filters is removed. This setting stops that, so every category always exists.</p></li><li><p><b>Short Browsing History</b>: By default, this website creates a new entry in your browsing history every time you switch tabs. This can quickly fill up your browsing history. This setting makes it so changing tabs does not effect the page history.</p></li></ul></li></ul><p>Lastly, there are the save management settings. These are powerful settings, so be careful when using one.</p><p>Import Save allows you to load a save from a file or from the clipboard. You can create a save in the clipboard or in a file using the options from Export Save.</p><p>Lastly, there is an option to delete your save data. This deletes everything, including settings, and cannot be undone except by loading a previous save (Assuming you created one).</p><p>After importing or deleting a save, it is recommended that you refresh the page, or at least change tabs, before attempting to make any changes.</p><p>There is a small message at the bottom of the page when using any of the save management settings. If that box is red, it means the action you tried to do failed, so read it carefully!</p></section><section class="content-section hidden"><h2>Miscellaneous</h2><p>This section covers features and information about the website not specific to a single tab.</p><p>In the top right, you'll see Update <span id="home-update-ver"></span>. This site is updated manually, so that number lets you know what version of the app the site is updated to. Any new units, upgrades/forms, or mechanics that are added in an update after the one displayed have not been added yet, so please be patient :)</p><p>Throughout the site, there are several tables containing multiple units. These tables have a settings button in the top right, where you can filter the units shown in the table, or quickly modify all of the units.</p><p>By activating Quick-Edit Mode, all selected options to the left will be applied when clicking the + button that normally opens the unit's stats. Disable Quick-Edit Mode to be able to access stats again.</p><img src="./assets/img/home-tutorial/pre-quick-change.png" loading="lazy"><p>↓</p><img src="./assets/img/home-tutorial/quick-change.png" loading="lazy"><p>↓</p><img src="./assets/img/home-tutorial/post-quick-change.png" loading="lazy"><p>Many of these tables will also have units with orb slots. By clicking a slot, you can create or modify an orb to give to that unit.</p><img src="./assets/img/home-tutorial/orb-modal-example.png" loading="lazy"><p>Orbs are divided into two types: Ability orbs and Effect orbs. Effect orbs increase a unit's effectiveness against a specific trait, while Ability orbs give the unit a new unique ability. The above image shows an effect orb being created.</p><p>Thoughout the site there are also several places where you can search for units. These places all also have a + button that opens up an advanced search.</p><p>The advanced search lets you filter search results by properties of a unit, like their rarity or abilities.</p><img src="./assets/img/home-tutorial/advanced-search.png" loading="lazy"><p>In the above image, the search required the unit to be an Uber Super Rare that can target Angel, Alien, and Aku, and that has the Conjure ability. As of 14.5, the only unit that meets these criteria is Mamolan Pasalan.</p><p>Lastly, if you encounter any errors with the site, unit values that are incorrect, or just have something that you think it's really important gets added, please let me know! On the GitHub, there is a few issue templates for different possible issues. Please use one of those, but before you do, double check that there isn't actually a mistake on the Wiki or from your end.</p></section><section class="content-section hidden"><h2>Credits/Copyright</h2><div class="home-citation"><a href="https://battlecats.miraheze.org/wiki/Battle_Cats_Wiki">https://battlecats.miraheze.org/wiki/Battle_Cats_Wiki</a><p>For unit data, images, and data validation.</p></div><div class="home-citation"><a href="https://thanksfeanor.pythonanywhere.com/xpcurves">https://thanksfeanor.pythonanywhere.com/xpcurves</a><p>For providing more accurate XP level curves for old/weird collab units.</p></div><div class="home-citation"><a href="https://mygamatoto.com">https://mygamatoto.com</a><p>For unit data and generally being a helpful source of information.</p></div><div class="home-citation"><a href="https://github.com/battlecatsinfo/battlecatsinfo.github.io">https://github.com/battlecatsinfo/battlecatsinfo.github.io</a><p>For having a lot of information about the Japanese version of the game.</p></div><div class="home-citation"><a href="https://github.com/battlecatsultimate/BCU-java-PC">https://github.com/battlecatsultimate/BCU-java-PC</a><p>For several images that are a pain to find otherwise.</p></div><p>And of course PONOS Corporation for making the game!</p><h4>Copyright Notice</h4><p>All data and images from The Battle Cats, as well as the name, brand, and any other related content, belong to PONOS Corporation.
